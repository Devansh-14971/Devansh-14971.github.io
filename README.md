So, I want to create a website that allows the user to view many things. Its main aim is to help inform the many about the state of the globe.
The main things I want to implement are:
> A heat map that overlays the temperature of a location with its position on the world map.
> A rain map that overlays the future predictions of rainfall of various places onto their positions on a world map. The pop-up allows the user to see the ground-water levels in the place as well as the latest records of rainfall. The pop up also includes links to the official sites that survey such information.
> An earthquake map that shows fault lines and shows an alert on predicted earthquake zones. It has pop-ups that on hovering on the fault lines that overlays recent earthquakes on the fault lines that have caused them(Radial from fault line, with colour intensity showing the magnitude).
> A disaster map that overlays current disasters onto the map, with links to articles generated by web crawlers. Disasters include : Earthquakes, floods, droughts, faine, hurricanes, tsunamis, plagues, etc. (Get from WHO sites)
